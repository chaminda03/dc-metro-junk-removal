# Email Integration Setup for Contact Form

## Overview
The contact form has been implemented and is ready to send emails to `info@weehaulnow.com`. The current setup logs the form data to the console. To enable actual email sending, you need to choose and configure one of the following email services:

## Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended - Frontend Solution)
EmailJS is the easiest to set up and works directly from the frontend.

### Setup Steps:
1. Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create an account
2. Create an email template with placeholders for: `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{phone}}`, `{{description}}`
3. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
4. Update the ContactForm component with EmailJS integration

### Benefits:
- No backend configuration needed
- Free tier available
- Simple integration
- Reliable delivery

## Option 2: Resend API (Backend Solution)
Modern email API with great deliverability.

### Setup Steps:
1. Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to environment variables: `RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here`
4. Install: `npm install resend`
5. Update the `/api/contact/route.ts` file

### Example Code:
```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend'

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

// In your API route:
await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
  to: 'info@weehaulnow.com',
  subject: 'New Quote Request - Wee Haul Junk Removal',
  html: emailContent
})
```

## Option 3: Zapier Webhook (No-Code Solution)
Create a Zapier automation that receives webhook data and sends emails.

### Setup Steps:
1. Create a Zapier account
2. Create a webhook trigger
3. Add Gmail/Outlook action to send email
4. Update the webhook URL in `/api/contact/route.ts`

## Option 4: Nodemailer with SMTP
Use your existing email provider's SMTP settings.

### Setup Steps:
