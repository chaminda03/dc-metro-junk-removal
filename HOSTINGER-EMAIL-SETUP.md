#### Step 2: Add Domain (Optional but Recommended)
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your domain: `weehauljunkdc.com`
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides to Hostinger DNS
4. Wait for verification (usually instant)

#### Step 3: Create API Key
1. Go to **API Keys** in Resend dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name it: `Wee Haul Contact Form`
4. **Copy the API key** (starts with `re_...`)

#### Step 4: Add to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. Add: `RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_api_key_here`
3. Redeploy your project

#### Step 5: Install Resend (I'll do this for you)
```bash
npm install resend
```

## ðŸ”§ OPTION 2: EmailJS with Hostinger SMTP

Use the main `EMAIL-SETUP-GUIDE.md` with these Hostinger settings:

**Hostinger SMTP Settings:**
- **SMTP Server**: `smtp.hostinger.com`
- **Port**: `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **Username**: `info@weehaulnow.com`
- **Password**: Your Hostinger email password
- **Security**: TLS/STARTTLS

## âš¡ Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Resend if:**
- âœ… You want professional email delivery
- âœ… You don't mind adding DNS records
- âœ… You want better deliverability
- âœ… You want server-side email sending

**Choose EmailJS if:**
- âœ… You want zero DNS setup
- âœ… You prefer client-side email sending
- âœ… You want to use existing Hostinger credentials

**My Recommendation**: **Resend** - It's more professional and reliable for business use.
